# GPA and CGPA Calculator

This Python script allows you to calculate your GPA (Grade Point Average) or CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) based on the grades and credits of your subjects or semesters. You can also modify values after entry for evaluation.

## How to Use

2. Enter "GPA" when prompted for your choice.
3. Enter the number of subjects you want to calculate GPA for.
4. For each subject:
   - Enter the credit value of the subject.
   - Enter the grade obtained in the exam (refer to the grade values below).
5. After entering all values, you will see your credits and grades separately.
6. Your GPA will be displayed.

**Grade Values:**

- "O": 10
- "A+": 9
- "A": 8
- "B+": 7
- "B": 6
- "RA": 0

You can verify your inputs, and if needed, change credits or grades before final calculation.

### CGPA Calculation

1. Run the script.
2. Enter "CGPA" when prompted for your choice.
3. Enter the number of semesters you want to calculate CGPA for.
4. Enter the GPA for each semester.
5. After entering all values, your CGPA will be displayed.

## Interpretation of Results

The script also provides interpretation based on your GPA or CGPA:

- If your GPA or CGPA is above 9.5, it will display "congrats, you are a Gold medalist."
- If it's between 8.5 and 9.5, it will display "congrats, you are in the 1st class with distinction."
- If it's between 7.5 and 8.5, it will display "congrats, you are in the 1st class."
- If it's between 6 and 7.5, it will suggest that you can achieve the 1st class with more effort.
- If it's below 6, it will display "Don't worry, failure is a stepping stone to success."

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the script file (`.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Run the script using `python script_name.py` (replace `script_name.py` with the actual script filename).
